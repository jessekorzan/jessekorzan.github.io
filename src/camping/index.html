		Where to stay when you are here</h1>
		
		<h3>Currently there are no hotels or B&Bs in Burlington, Middle Arm or Smith's Harbour specifically... we're working on it.</h3>
		
		<h3>Burlington is three hours west of Gander and two and a half hours east of Corner Brook - sorta right in the middle. Below are some links to Accommodations within a three hour driving distance of Burlington, either way. Some are much closer - with the closest listings at the top. When in doubt, check Google Maps:</h3>

		<h3>The closest accommodations are the Baie Vista Inn, Dorset Country Inn and Flatwater Pond Park - all about 30 minutes away.</h3>
		
		<h3>If none of these options work for you, feel free to reserve a camp site and pitch a tent in beautiful Perry's Cove. Only $10.00 for the weekend!</h3>
		
		<h3>Camping Passes start at 12pm on Friday, Aug 23 and end at 12:00pm on Sunday. Passes are for one tent, and however many people you can fit inside it. If you have too many people for one tent, then bring two tents and book two passes. Space is limited so reserve your spot now.</h3> 
		
		<h3>You can also bring a camper or an RV. We'll try to help you out with somewhere to park it. </h3>
		
		<h3>***THE GLAMPING TENTS WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR THE GATHERING AS THEY ARE RESERVED FOR ARTISTS AND CHEFS</h3>
